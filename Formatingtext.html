    Coding is similar to a puzzle,
    each small piece has its own name.
    We type the words, the screen will show,
    The things we have told the code to know.

    Sometimes things do not work just right,
    We fix and try with all our might.
    At last it runs, we smile with pride,
    Our little program comes alive inside.
