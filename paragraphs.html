<pre>
    I lift my eyes to the hills-
    where does my help come from?
    My help comes from the LORD,
    The maker of heaven and eath.
    <br>
    he will not let your foot slip-
    He who watches over you will not slumber;
    indeed he who watches over Israel
    will neither slumber nor sleep.
</pre>
